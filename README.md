# Py-Weighted-Loot-Table
 A simple weighted loot table

 I mainly created this as quick way to help me with learning python
 This is a python re-wrtite of C++ code from the game I am making
 It can be used for weighted loot tables for games or just anything that you want to use a weighted random for

### How it works:

- This takes in a list of items and weights and chooses a random item based on the weights
- Weights are how likely an item is to be picked and are relative
- For example an item with a weight of 10 is 10 times more likely to be picked than a weight of 1 and twice as likely as a weight of 5
- You don't have to start you weights at 1, You can start at any positive number
- You can edit the loot dict to change loot and its weight
